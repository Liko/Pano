# Pano
A social network taking a wider perspective

Pano is a social network for panoramic pictures. It takes a unique approach by focusing on sharing omniderctional snapshots of situations that the users find themselves in. In the future, this approach can be expanded to include AR and VR applications such as head tracking for panning within pictures or even fully immersive 360Â° panoramas that capture the full extend of the situation that a user wants to share.

Pano was deployed under www.panoapp.co.uk. However, unfortunately, our azure credits have run out. While we scramble to fix this situation, here are some screenshots that show a locally hosted version:Pano/screenshots/login.pngPano/screenshots/login.pngPano/screenshots/login.pngPano/screenshots/login.pngPano/screenshots/login.pngPano/screenshots/login.png
